<li id="transferrights">The <secondpartyrole/> transfers to <company_short/> all the intellectual property rights which the <secondpartyrole/> has been granted in the performance of the work. If it is not possible to transfer these rights, the <secondpartyrole/> grants <company_short/> a perpetual, exclusive, transferrable, sub licensable worldwide licence with regard to the rights and the <secondpartyrole/> agrees to cooperate with the transfer of these rights to <company_short/>. Once the rights of the <secondpartyrole/> are transferred to <company_short/>, grants <company_short/> a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sub licensable, worldwide licence for such rights to the <secondpartyrole/>, unless <company_short/> deems this to be impossible as a result of the obligations which <company_short/> has with regard to third parties. In that case, <company_short/> will investigate whether it is possible to grant the <secondpartyrole/> a more limited licence.</li>
