<li><p><company_short/> will pay the <secondpartyrole/> <contractor_hourly_fee/> per hour excluding VAT. It will do so after <company_short/> has received an invoice from the <secondpartyrole/>. The <secondpartyrole/> will send an invoice within 14 days after the end of each calendar month for the Activities performed during that month.</p>
<p><company_short/> will then pay the agreed amount within 30 days of receipt of the invoice. <company_short/> will also pay reasonable travel expenses of the <secondpartyrole/>, to the extent that <company_short/> has given prior written approval for such costs and the <secondpartyrole/> provides <company_short/> with an invoice or other documentation for these expenses. <company_short/> will not reimburse any other costs the <secondpartyrole/> incurs in the course of the Activities, unless <company_short/> has given prior written approval for such costs. For the avoidance of doubt, <company_short/> shall pay no wages (in Dutch: "<i>salaris</i>") to the <secondpartyrole/> and therefore, <company_short/> shall not provide payslips to the <secondpartyrole/>, nor pay to the <secondpartyrole/> any money or allowance in the event of a holiday or illness of the <secondpartyrole/>.</p></li>
