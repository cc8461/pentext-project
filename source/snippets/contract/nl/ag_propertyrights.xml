<li>The <secondpartyrole/> transfers to <company_short/> all intellectual property rights created as a result of the Activities. To the extent that it is not possible to transfer these rights, <contractor_personal_pronoun/> grants to <company_short/> a perpetual, exclusive transferable, sub-licensable, world-wide license to such rights, and agrees to co-operate with the transfer of these rights to <company_short/>. To the extent that the <secondpartyrole/> has transferred these rights to <company_short/>, <company_short/> grants a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, not-sub-licensable, world-wide license to such rights to the <secondpartyrole/>, unless <company_short/> considers this impossible, due to obligations <company_short/> might have vis-Ã -vis others. In that case, <company_short/> will explore whether it is possible to grant to the <secondpartyrole/> a license on the rights with a narrower scope. For the avoidance of doubt, any rights of the <secondpartyrole/> vested in software or services developed prior to the Activities are not affected by this agreement.</li>
