  <title>The Black-Box Pentesting Method</title>
  <p>
    Crystal-Box vs. Black-Box pentesting refers to the amount of information
    about the target environment, architecture, and/or applications that the
    customer initially shares with the pentesters. With Black-Box testing,
    pentesters are given no information whatsoever about the target(s). With
    Crystal-Box testing, pentesters are given all information requested about
    the target(s), including source code (when relevant), access to developers
    or system management, etc.
  </p>
  <p>In this case <company_short/> will conduct a black-Box test.</p>
