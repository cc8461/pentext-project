    <company_short/> will perform <company_svc_long/> for <client_short/>
    as a follow-up on the previous test in <b><todo desc="replace this todo element with [timeframe of previous pentest]"/>
    </b>. The services are intended to see if the
    previously discovered exploits are patched correctly. To do so,
    <company_short/> will access the systems again and test the findings
    from the previous penetration test (the “<b>Targets</b>”):
  </p>

  <generate_targets/>

  <p>
    <company_short/> will test using both publicly available vulnerability
    scanning tools and manual testing. <company_short/> shall perform a
   <p_boxtype/> follow-up penetration test via the internet between <p_startdate/> and <p_enddate/>.

  <!--p>It is possible that in the course of the penetration
  testing, <company_short/> might hinder the operations of the Targets or
  cause damage to the Targets. <client_short/> gives permission for this, to
  the extent that <company_short/> does not act negligently or
  recklessly. <client_short/> also warrants it has the authority to give such
  permission.</p-->

  <!--p>It is important to understand the limits of
  <company_short/>'s services. <company_short/> does not (and cannot)
  give guarantees that something is secure. <company_short/> instead has
  an obligation to make reasonable efforts (in Dutch:
  “<i>inspanningsverplichting</i>”) to perform the agreed services.</p-->
