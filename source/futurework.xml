  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Retest of findings</b>
      <br/> When mitigations for the vulnerabilities described in this report have been deployed, a
      repeat test should be performed to ensure that they are effective and have not introduced
      other security problems. </li>
    <li>
      <b>Regular security assessments</b>
      <br/> Security is an ongoing process and not a product, so we advise undertaking regular
      security assessments and penetration tests, ideally prior to every major release or every
      quarter. </li>
