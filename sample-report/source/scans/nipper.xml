    <p>We used nipper-ng with the following command:</p>
    <pre>nipper --screenos --input=config.conf --output=audit.html</pre>
    <p>to audit the Juniper NetScreen firewall config that Sitting Duck NOC provided us with.</p>
<p>The reported CVEs were checked manually, none were deemed relevant to this scenario.</p>
